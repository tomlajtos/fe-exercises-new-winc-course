# fe-exercises-new-winc-course
Old front end course at Winc Academy was replaced by this uodated one. All the new
exercesis will go in this repo while finishing up the course. Also, for practicing and
to see if there is any difference, I'll go thrugh the alredy completed topics and put the
code for those here as well.

The purpose of this repo is:
 - to keep a record of my learning journey
 - show the progress (hopefully) throughout time
 - to keep practice code separate from assignments and actual project repositories
